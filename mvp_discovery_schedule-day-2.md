## UI Sprint Introduction
Our goal is to explore as many possibilities as possible, regardless of how realistic, feasible or viable they may or may not be. From this explosion of opportunity comes insights made when considering the implications of radically different perspectives on and approaches to solving a problem. These insights can become valuable differentiating forces and the source of unique solution inspiration. Also, once we begin eliminating as many of these options as possible we are given reason to be more confident in the options we do move forward with because we have explored so many alternatives.

### Independant Sketches
#### Materials:
* Notebook or Printer paper
* Thick markers (like Sharpies)
* Camera (To take pictures of your sketches)


With all of yesterdays work fresh in our minds, break off individually and sketch a UI solution for the critical path. The short time limit is to help you focus on quickly expressing ideas, rather then creating something aesthetic. Use thick markers to further reinforce the idea of painting in broad strokes. No idea is a bad idea, explore unique solutions in your sketches rather than just bowing to convention or trends. At this stage adventerous ideas are embraced!

**Make sure to work alone, no working together(right now)!**

### Review Sketches
After the time limit is up, come back and post your sketch(es). Don't explain anything just yet.
After every one's work has been posted, look through everyones sketches and make notes on which aspects of each design you like. You can "star" a design as many times as you'd like, including your own!

1. Once everyone has starred what they like, gather around a sketch or Storyboard.
2. Ask people what they liked about it.
3. Ask the person that had the idea to add any more explanation that they think hasn't been covered or if something was misunderstood.


#### Break again and repeat!
Feel free to take/steal other team mates ideas and remix them as your own. Integrate them into your work to make even better ideas!

## Convergence

Once we start to reach a convergence of ideas we can be confident that we've created something with good design direction. At this point the design and dev team members can work together to put together a low fidelity mockup to put in front of users in order to verify our assumptions.
